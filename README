Thread Pool Implementation using Pthreads

/* Initialize the threadpool with "num_threads" number of threads */
int threadpool_init(int num_threads);

/* Reset the current number of threads in the pool to "num_threads".
 * If "num_threads" is less than the currently executing threads, 
 * then this number is reduced as the threads finish executing. 
 * Otherwise, new threads are created. */
int threadpool_set(int num_threads);

/* Run the "task" in the threadpool */
int threadpool_run_task((void *)(*task)(void *));

/* Wait for all threads to finish and exit */
int threadpool_exit();

/* Abort execution of all threads and exit */
int threadpool_abort();
